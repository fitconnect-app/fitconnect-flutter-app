FitConnect is a solution to address the challenge of being unable to find individuals or groups with whom to engage in physical activity or play a particular sport, by providing a platform for students to connect with like-minded individuals, checking sports availability in a facility, offer specific tools at the sports center, and notifying them about relevant preferences. This app can help users overcome logistical and social barriers, foster a sense of community, and encourage ongoing engagement in physical activity, promoting improved physical and mental health.
